### WORK EXPERIENCE
## Children's National Hospital | Machine Learning Engineer Jun 2022- Aug 2023
Washington, District of Columbia, USA
• Developed an encoder-decoder neural network model for CT scan tumor segmentation, achieving a 0.92 Dice Similarity coefficient and 96% precision with AWS SageMaker, enhancing tumor region identification.
• Efficiently deployed the model in a production environment using Docker and Kubernetes, ensuring scalable deployment across hospital networks. Integrated with a RESTful API, the model enabled real-time medical image analysis in patient management systems.
• Fine-tuned a Falcon7B large language model on a private patient dataset utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique and deployed it on a Hugging Face server. This enhanced radiologist support, improving patient data labeling and annotation through feedback analysis.

## Verzeo | Junior Data Scientist Sep 2020- April 2021
Bengaluru, India
• Developed and optimized SQL queries along with stored procedures using Snowflake to enhance data analysis and business reporting.
• Constructed and managed a data warehouse and lake using AWS Redshift and AWS Glue, ensuring high data quality and security.
• Maintained a membership database, creating and managing Stored Procedures, Functions, Views, Triggers, and complex SQL queries.
• Successfully deployed a recommendation engine to production, using A/B testing and chi-squared methods to suggest courses based on user order history, resulting in a 12% increase in course sales.

## Saudi Aramco Mobil Refinery Co Ltd | Data Analyst Intern Feb 2019-Sep 2020
Al-Khobar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
• Executed ETL processes to load data from various sources, such as Excel, CSV, XML, and JSON files, into the data warehouse.
• Integrated data from various sources, such as RDS, DynamoDB, and API endpoints, using AWS Glue and Python scripts.
• Implemented a time-series analysis pipeline using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to forecast petroleum export trends, enhancing decision-making and strategy formulation. Utilized this analysis to create dynamic Tableau dashboards, providing real-time monitoring and predictive insights into petroleum exports.
